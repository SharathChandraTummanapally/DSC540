    "Extracting the Top 100 eBooks from Gutenberg Project Gutenberg encourages the creation and distribution of eBooks by encouraging volunteer efforts to digitize and archive cultural works. This activity aims to scrape the URL of Project Gutenberg's Top 100 eBooks to identify the eBooks' links. It uses BeautifulSoup4 to parse the HTML and regular expression code to identify the Top 100 eBook file numbers. You can use those book ID numbers to download the book into your local drive if you want. Head over to the supplied Jupyter notebook (in the GitHub repository) to work on this activity. These are the steps that will help you solve this activity:"
